# Voicelle
This is the various code for Voicecelle. Voicelle's goal is to help those with hearing-impairments by transcribing either video files, audio files, or user input through a microphone. The speech transcription will also be marked with time stamps that coincide with the original file. 
This project is for the Colorado School of Mines Computing for the Good Summer Internship.

*COME BACK AND EDIT THIS PART!* Not sure how this will work past downlaoding the files as I don't know what the GUI will look like. 

# Examples/Output
Here is an example of the output text file.
